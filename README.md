# portfolio2018

A custom built site to showcase projects, maybe run a blog, and ultimately get me some work. It's WIP and supposed to be fun, animated and modern.

It started as a chance to mess around with velocity JS so was hardcoded. Then I missed all the goodness of js modules, so I updated it to use webpack. I was also doing some shady js dynamic node appending.

Now i'm getting ready to change over to react for the view engine as well as set up a Documentational DB that will be the source for project pages/ posts/ etc...

Haven't made a production build yet.

to get up and running run `npm install` and `npm run start`
