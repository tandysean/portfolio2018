# portfolio2018

A custom built site to showcase projects, maybe run a blog, and ultimately get me some gigs. It's WIP and supposed to be fun, animated
and modern. It's a good chance for me to play around with interaction design and will likely use ReactJS for the view.

Modern modular JavaScript and uses webpack. No production build yet as it's in active development.

to get up and running run `npm install` and `npm run start`
